# Vision project
Project for the university course Vision and Cognitive Services.

We used a small subset of ImageNet, Pascal, Places and other datasets:
- Imagenette: https://github.com/fastai/imagenette
- https://github.com/EliSchwartz/imagenet-sample-images
- Pascal: https://deepai.org/dataset/pascal-voc
- Places: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/places
- Birds
- Flowers
