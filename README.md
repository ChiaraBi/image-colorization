# Vision project
Project for the university course Vision and Cognitive Services.

We used a small subset of both the ImageNet and Pascal datasets:
- Imagenette: https://github.com/fastai/imagenette
- https://github.com/EliSchwartz/imagenet-sample-images
- Pascal: https://deepai.org/dataset/pascal-voc

Here you can find the pretrained models used in this project:
- Dahl: https://tinyclouds.org/colorize/ (Download section)
- eccv_16: https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/colorizers/eccv16.py
- siggraph17: https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/colorizers/siggraph17.py
